# MLTrainController
Welcome to this quick demo showcasing the power of AI-supported software in interacting with real-world objects! In this example, weâ€™re using a LEGO locomotive and an iPhone equipped with a camera. The app installed on the phone utilizes a machine learning-based object detection algorithm to track the exact position of the train in real time.

As the locomotive moves along the track, the app continuously monitors its location and communicates with the train via Bluetooth. Based on its position, the software intelligently controls the locomotive, ensuring it shuttles smoothly between two stations located at opposite ends of the track.

This is just one example of how AI and automation can be used to enhance everyday objects, making them smarter and more interactive! ðŸš‚
